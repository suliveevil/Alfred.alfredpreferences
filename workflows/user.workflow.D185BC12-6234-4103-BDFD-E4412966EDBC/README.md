## Usage

You can press `Enter` to open the file in result, or press `‚åòCMD-Enter` to reveal it in Finder.

### Tap `rr` to list files opened recently by the foremost app.

For example:

- Recent folders will be listed when Finder is foremost.
- Recent rtf, text files will be listed when TextEdit app is foremost.
- Recent *.sketch files will be listed when Sketch app is foremost.
- Recent *.xcodeproj project files will be listed when Xcode app is foremost.

The subtitle of each result consists of **‚è±modified time** and **üì°path** of the file.

### Tap `rf` to list recent folders.

Opening recent folders is very common in use. Tapping `rf` is a more efficient way, even though you can activate Finder and then tap `rr`.

### Tap `rd` to list recent files.  

These files were recently opened by user, not like `rr` which is just for the foremost app.

### Exclude folders from the results.

You can add private folder pathes separated by colon `:` to the Workflow Environment Variable `ExcludedFolders`. The results will not show private folders and any files inside them.

For example: `~/privateFolder1/:/Users/G/privateFolder2/`
